# Overview

FortiSOAR, in its unwavering quest for efficiency and user-centricity, reaches another significant milestone with the release of its AI-powered security assistant, the "FortiAI".

Using the power of Generative AI, the 'Advisor' answers your questions contextually regarding security threats, response processes, work plans, Jinja expressions, and more. Its unique feature is its ability to generate playbook blocks tailored to scenarios defined by you, giving you a head start in automating and enhancing your use cases. Whether you are a seasoned playbook developer or just starting out, FortiAI is your go-to partner for streamlined and efficient playbook design.

In its first avatar, the FortiAI ships in the “Preview” mode with the intention of gathering user feedback and learning how users want to employ generative AI in their day-to-day usage to respond to queries and generate playbooks. In brief, FortiSOAR Advisor's initial release offers the following features:

- Generation of playbooks to build workflows for your security use-cases. 
- Generic AI interactions such as assistance with Jinja expressions, gaining awareness of security processes to create comprehensive response plans,  obtaining details on how to develop a specific kind of playbook, etc.
- Contextual answers to your questions through natural language conversations around threats, response procedures, etc., in the case management views such as while investigating an alert. 

### Data Privacy Notice 

The FortiAI lets you connect your Fortinet account to your own OpenAI account, using your own OpenAI ChatGPT API key. This integration will send data from your Fortinet account to OpenAI and will show you responses from OpenAI.  Fortinet does not verify or correct these responses and has no responsibility for them.  ChatGPT is operated by a third party, not Fortinet.  You must exercise discretion and independently verify any information or recommendations you receive from OpenAI before relying on them.

Before using the Advisor, we recommend that you review OpenAI’s API Platform privacy policy to understand how your data may be used and protected. By continuing to use Advisor, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in OpenAI’s privacy policy.
